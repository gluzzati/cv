Quick Http Messages \\
\cvitem{5GIC}{2018}
\tinyexpbox{This project was a proof of concept to provide a barebone, simple playground to test ideas and allow quick prototyping in HTTP service based architectures, such as the 5G core network. The core idea was to implement a simple HTTP server over bare UDP, to minimize latency. The C++ source code for this project is available at \url{https://github.com/giuliol/quick-http-messages}.
