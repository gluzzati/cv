Touch Model \\
\cvitem{Individual Project, Cambridge Touch Technologies}{2020}
\tinyexpbox{A research on human touch interaction models, this project provides experimental data and insights to support and direct hardware and algorithm design decisions.
I designed and prototyped the hardware and software needed to provide a generalized ``experiment'' platform, to collect touch force profiles for different use cases.
The second part was focused on processing and analysing the gathered data, to refine insights from the aggregate.
The outcome from this phase of the project is parametrized mathematical models for several basic touch interaction modes.
The project's results have been used to drive the design of silicon.
