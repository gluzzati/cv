Touch Model \\
\cvitem{Individual Project, Cambridge Touch Technologies}{2020}
\tinyexpbox{A research on human touch interaction models, this project provides experimental data and insights to support hardware and algorithm design.
I designed and prototyped the hardware and software needed to collect touch force profiles for different interaction types.
The second part of the project was focused on processing and analysing the data, to refine insights from the aggregate, in the form of parametrized mathematical models.
The project's results have been used to drive the design of silicon.
