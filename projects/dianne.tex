DSP Pipeline Porting \\
\cvitem{Software Lead, Cambridge Touch Technologies}{2021}

Startups need to move quick and prototype rapidly. This project is aimed at porting the majority of the DSP processing algorithms from a ``proof of concept'' to a first production state.
My role in the project is that of the software lead.
The main challenges I'm facing 
\begin{itemize}
\item Establish policies for contributing to the codebase
\item Establishing from the start a modular software architecture and build system, to allow easy regression testing and support multiple platforms
\item Targeting extremely low footprint MCUs 
\item Set up the infrastructure for continuous testing and integration
\end{itemize}
The project is ongoing.
