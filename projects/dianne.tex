DSP Pipeline Porting \\

Startups need to move quick, prototype and prove concepts rapidly. This project is aimed at porting the majority of the DSP processing algorithms from a ``proof of concept'' to a first production state.
My role in the project is that of the software lead.
The main challenges I'm facing are such as 
\begin{itemize}
\item Establish policies for contributing to the codebase
\item Establishing from the start a modular software architecture and build system, to allow easy regression testsing and support multiple platforms
\item Targeting extremely low footprint MCUs 
\item Set up the infrastructure for continuous testing and integration, with dockers and build servers
\end{itemize}
The project is ongoing.
