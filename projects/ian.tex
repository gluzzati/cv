Touchscreen Analyser\\
\cvitem{Project Manager, Cambridge Touch Technologies}{2019}
\tinyexpbox{A tool to perform impedance spectroscopy to diagnose manifacturing defects of pressure sensing enabled displays. 
It automatically generates easy to read reports containing physical measures and inferred features.
My role in the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item designed the flow of operations, data format and structures, and system level architecture 
\item coded most of the software and the GUI 
\item designed and coded signal and data processing algorithms (feature extraction, classification)
\item automated PDF report generation
\end{itemize}
The finished prototype was validated against known samples, and successfully flagged manually undetected defects.}
