Signal Injector for Pressure Sensors\\
\cvitem{Project manager, Cambridge Touch Technologies}{2019}
\tinyexpbox{The goal of the project was to realize a signal injector, able to ``simulate'' the behaviour of the physical sensor. An array of DACs at its core, the deliverable consisted in a small box, controlled via REST api, able to physically interface to the pressure sensor amplifier. My role in the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item specified the requirements 
\item designed the high level architecture  
\item implemented driver, API 
\item integration (as slave component) with other existing diagnostic tools
\end{itemize}

The tool proved to be useful and usable, and after the prototype, several units of the tool have been commissioned and are in use by the hardware team.
