Quick Http Messages \\
\cvitem{Individual Project, 5GIC}{2018}
\tinyexpbox{This project was a proof of concept to provide a barebone framework to test ideas and quickly prototype in service based architectures (SbA), such as the 5G core network. The core idea was to implement a simple HTTP server over UDP, to minimize latency. Source code for this project available at \url{https://github.com/giuliol/quick-http-messages}.
Additionally, I realized a simple automatic generator able to parse 3GPP OpenAPI compliant YML for the 5G SbA and generate stubs for their REST APIs.
