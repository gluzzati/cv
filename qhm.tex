Quick Http Messages \\
\cvitem{Individual Project, 5GIC}{2018}
\tinyexpbox{This project was a proof of concept to provide a barebone, simple playground to test ideas and allow quick prototyping in HTTP service based architectures (SbA), such as the 5G core network. The core idea was to implement a simple HTTP server over bare UDP, to minimize latency. The C++ source code for this project is available at \url{https://github.com/giuliol/quick-http-messages}.
As one-man project, I designed and implemented the entire system. Additionally, I realized a simple automatic generator tool, able to parse 3GPP OpenAPI compliant YML definitions of components in the 5G SbA and generate stubs for their REST APIs.
