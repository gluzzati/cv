Touchscreen Analyser\\
\cvitem{Project Manager, Cambridge Touch Technologies}{2019}
\tinyexpbox{This tool was aimed at diagnosing manifacturing defects of pressure sensing enabled touch panels. The scope of the project was to harness existing experiments and components in the company, and integrate them organically into a usable tool.
The instrument analyses the electrodes of capacitive touch panels, and automatically generates easy to read reports containing physical measures and inferred features.
My role in the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item designed the workflow, the data flow and system level architecture 
\item realized a simple GUI 
\item signal and data processing algorithms, i.e. extracting knowledge from the data
\item automatic report generation
\end{itemize}
