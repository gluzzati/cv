Touchscreen Analyser\\
\cvitem{Project Manager, Cambridge Touch Technologies}{2019}
\tinyexpbox{This tool was aimed at diagnosing manifacturing defects of pressure sensing enabled touch panels. The scope of the project was to harness existing experiments and components in the company, and integrate them organically into a usable tool.
The instrument analyses the electrodes of capacitive touch panels, and automatically generates easy to read reports containing physical measures and inferred features.
My role in the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item designed the flow of operations, data format and structures, and system level architecture 
\item coded most of the software and the GUI 
\item designed and coded signal and data processing algorithms (feature extraction, classification)
\item automated report generation (Latex)
\end{itemize}
The tool as a proof of concept has sparked the interest of the management and its second iteration is now in design.
