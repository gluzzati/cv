Touch Model \\
\cvitem{Individual Project, Cambridge Touch Technologies}{2020}
\tinyexpbox{A research on human touch interaction models, this project provided experimental data and insights to support and direct product and algorithm design decisions.
I designed and prototyped the hardware and software needed to provide a generalized ``experiment'' platform, to collect touch force profiles for different use cases.
The second part was focused on processing and analysing the gathered data, to refine insights from the aggregate.
The outcome from this phase of the project is parametrized mathematical models for two basic interaction modes, that I devised from curve fitting in one case, and deriving from first principles in the other.
Such parametrized models can be now used to drive a more refined design process and as more ``human-like'' profiles for test machines.
