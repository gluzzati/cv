\section{Personal}
\cvitem{Music}{} 
I have experience in amateur music recording, as well as electronics DIY: I built a multichannel microphone pre-amplifier, CAD designing the PCB and employing SMD components. Recording and mixing taught me working knowledge of fundamentals and common problems of audio engineering.

%\cvitem{Mechanics}{} 
%I rebuilt several motorbike's engines and mechanics, either two and four stroke, this taught me analytical thinking and troubleshooting skills.

I am passionate about photography, both technique and practice, as well as its technological aspects.
