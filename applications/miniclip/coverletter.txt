Hello Miniclip, 

I would like to apply for the position of Senior Software Developer at your branch in Genoa.
I'm a software engineer with over 8 years of experience. I did my studies in Genoa, and after my Ph.D., in 2016, I decided to move to the UK to get out of my comfort zone and test my skills.
I'd like now to move back to Genoa, my hometown, and your advertisement on LinkedIn caught my eye - I think Miniclip could be a natural cultural match for my profile. 

I have been working in small startups during the last years, which taught me how to deal with fast paced environments, as well as the fundamental value of being flexible and fixing the problems in sight, (i.e., no "not my problem" attitude).

Software design and development has been my main day-to-day activity for the last years, while back in my Ph.D. years, I had the opportunity to study and have extensive exposure and experience with mathematics, geometry, linear algebra, and so on.

I would love to discuss more about Miniclip and its opportunities!


Thank you, 
Giulio Luzzati
