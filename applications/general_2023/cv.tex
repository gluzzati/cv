\section{In a\\Nutshell}~
\expbox{I am a software engineer with a strong scientific background. My drive is to design and analyse systems, understand what makes them tick and how they could be better. I strive to frame my actions holistically, and I have a track record of delivering solid, dependable, and (re)usable solutions.}

\section{Professional \\and Academic Experience} 

\textbf{Cambridge Touch Technologies (CTT)}, Cambridge, United Kingdom\\
\cvitem{DSP Team Leader}{Jan 2022 - currently}
\cvitem{Principal DSP Engineer}{Jul 2021 - Dec 2021}
\cvitem{Senior DSP Engineer}{Oct 2018 - Jun 2021}
\expbox{CTT is a tech scale-up, whose core business is to provide a cost effective technology to add touch-pressure sensing capabilities to display and non-display surfaces. 

At CTT I currently lead the research, development and implementation of the algorithms that are part of the core of the company IP.

The tech stack I contributed to design and implement comprises Matlab and Python for reference implementations, demos, scripts and glue code, and C for low level, embedded applications.

Major contributions include
\begin{itemize}
 \item developed the CI ecosystem, based on the Gitlab platform and state of the art dockerised build and test environments on a local cloud.
 \item implemented real time visualisations and developing environments to demonstrate, familiarise with, and tune DSP algorithms
 \item provided feedback to help develop the sensor technology
 \end{itemize}

\textbf{5G Innovation Centre}, Guildford, United Kingdom\\
\cvitem{Senior Software Engineer}{Nov 2017 - Oct 2018}
\expbox{The 5GIC is a research centre within the University of Surrey, featuring one of the biggest 5G testbeds in the UK with research and standardization activity in close partnership with some of the largest players in the field. The 5GIC's testbed, a complete cellular network, showcases several research ideas, from the physical layer to network concepts.
At the 5GIC I was part of the core network team. My contribution as a software engineer was to develop and maintain the codebase for the core network.}

\textbf{AKYA ltd}, Swindon, United Kingdom\\
\cvitem{DSP Software Engineer}{Dec 2016 - Nov 2017}
\expbox{AKYA's core business was a novel ``dynamically reconfigurable logic'' approach to hardware design, for low power/low cost applications, unlike e.g. FPGA, providing ``just enough'' reconfigurability to meet design requirements. 
At AKYA I contributed as a software engineer to develop a framework that synthesises RT logic from a high-level description of the hardware. My role was to design and develop algorithms and software components that expand and integrate the existing framework, as well as creating tools for testing and data visualization.}

\textbf{DSP Lab, University of Genova}, Genova, Italy\\
\cvitem{Post Doctoral Research Fellow}{Jan 2016 - Nov 2016}
\cvitem{Ph.D. Student}{Jan 2013 - Dec 2015}
\cvitem{Research Fellow}{Oct 2012 - Dec 2012}
\expbox{During my academic experience at the DSP Labs, as Ph.D. student and then research fellow, I carried out academic (research and teaching) activity, along with projects in collaboration with SMEs and some of the key industries of Italy's communications and tech (Telecom Italia, Leonardo). My main area of research were resource allocation and mathematical optimization in communication networks and in signal processing}
