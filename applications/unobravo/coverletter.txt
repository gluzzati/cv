I'm presently located in the UK and am looking to move back to Italy given the right job opportunity.

Although data analyst has not been the explicit job title in my past experiences, I believe my profile can be relevant because of the transferability of my skills and because data analysis is something I've been doing on a daily basis for the past few years.

My main criteria for my next role include the ability to work remotely, get the opportunity 
to solve challenging problems in a dynamic team that cares about its impact, and where my experience and inclinations are a good match to bring value to the company.

I think that our brain generates a stream of thoughts and emotions to make sense of reality. Because of its complexity, this stream tends to tangle up, and if we succeed in processing it, we linearize it and decouple it from emotions so that it integrates into useful knowledge. 
If we fail to do that, we can't make use of the tangled up data and we re-live emotions when recalling memories. I believe psychology is, among other things, the art of encouraging this process of linearization. It can happen by talking to a friend, we can learn to do that with journaling and self reflection, but there's undeniable value in relying on professionals to facilitate that peocess.
